We follow the model of \cite{abdel2014convolutional} wherein we first extract a two-dimensional spectrogram-like representation of the speech. We then apply a convolutional neural network to map this representation to a label. The representation used is simply a spectrogram which has been projected onto a log-frequency basis.

A spectrogram is a two dimensional representation of an audio waveform, often used to visualize speech and music. It expresses time in the horizontal axis and frequency in the vertical axis. Figure~\ref{fig:waveform} and \ref{fig:spectrogram} shows an example of this correspondence. In the example of Figure~\ref{fig:waveform} and in our experiments, the audio is sampled at 8kHz, and the frames of the spectrogram cover 256 samples (32ms) beginning every 32 samples (4ms).

Using the spectrogram we can read how the frequencies of the audio change over time. Each column of pixels in the spectrogram is the discrete Fourier transform of a ``frame'' - a short contiguous time slice of the waveform. These frames are equally spaced and of equal length, and are ordered by increasing time. The frames can overlap to create a smoother spectrogram. Each row of pixels in the spectrogram represents a frequency: the lowest row represents the constant component; the top row represents 4000 Hz (half the sampling frequency). The rows between are spaced linearly in the frequency space. The light-coloured bands we see in the spectrogram are the regions of high energy - these bands give some sense of the quality of the audio tone, and of its pitch.

The linear spacing of the frequency representation is not representative of human auditory perception, as humans hear multiplicative differencies in frequency as equivalent throughout the auditory range. As such, a shift in pitch - without a change in any other quality of the sound - would create a linear shift in the log-frequency domain, but a more complicated transformation in the spectrogram.

As such, we transform the spectrogram by mapping each column onto a log-frequency basis. These bases are spaced evenly in the mel scale; a mel is equivalent to $c log(1 + f / 700)$ where $c$ is some constant and $f$ is the frequency in Hz. See Figure~\ref{fig:mfsc}, which is the mel-frequency transformation of the spectrogram in Figure~\ref{fig:spectrogram}.
