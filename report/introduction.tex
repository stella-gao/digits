\section{Introduction}
\label{Introduction}
Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) are commonly-used machine learning techniques in the domain of speech recognition. Following from recent research \cite{abdel2014convolutional}, we convert our data to the mel-frequency spectral representation, and train CNN and RNN models to classify the audio input as the digit spoken. We examine the efficacy of our models on a relatively small subset of the TIDIGITS dataset as detailed in Section \ref{sec:data}. Section \ref{sec:cnn} outlines the theory behind CNNs. Sections \ref{sec:models} and \ref{sec:results} outline the models used and their results, respectively.
