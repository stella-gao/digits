## Outline

## TIDIGITS

## Adding figures

- PNG or other bitmaps can be included.  SVG can be included if your
  browser supports it.  This page shows an SVG file.

## Figures 2

However, if you want to centre/rescale images, you must switch to
html tag:

<center><img src="figs/carmen-workflow-crop.svg"
	height="350px"/></center>

## Adding sounds

Check your browser if it supports your file format. I found (on
firefox) is that file.mov did not play, but renaming it to file.mp4
worked. mp4/mov seems best cross-browser.  Here is an example movie;
see tags for controlling autoplay etc.

<center>
<video id="sampleMovie1" src="./figs/p11ctrlconv.mov" loop="true" autoplay="true" controls></video>
</center>

## Adding equations

Mathjax is supported, so with latex syntax you can get inline  \(A = \pi
\times r^2 \) or separate maths:

\[
\begin{aligned}
I_{1} &= \int_{0}^{2*\pi} \sin(x)
\\
I_{2} &= \int_{0}^{2*\pi} \cos(x)
\end{aligned}
\]

## Tables

Simple tables can be included.  More complicated ones could be output
from xtable() in R:


Table Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Table Cell    | Cell 2
Cell 3        | Cell 4
Cell 5        | Cell 6


## Citations

Citations can be included in your talk, with a "References" slide at
the end.  For example, @Xie2013 and @Gentleman2004.
